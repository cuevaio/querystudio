- **Context**: Consider existing queries to avoid duplication and provide complementary content
- **Relevance**: Ensure the query is directly related to the topic and company context

## Query Types (Choose the most appropriate)

- **Process Questions**: "How do I [customer action] through [COMPANY NAME]'s [service]?"
- **Limits & Requirements**: "What's the maximum [action] limit for [COMPANY NAME] [service]?"
